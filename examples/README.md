# examples
The scripts in this directory follows the [rabbitmq tutorial](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html).
My goal is to implement the features required on the broker to run all the tutorials from rabbitmq.

## dependencies
Make sure you have python installed on your machine.

The AMQP client used in these examples is [pika](https://github.com/pika/pika).
You can install it by running:
```
Î» pip install -r requirements.txt
```
